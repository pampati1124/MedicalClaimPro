# Medical Insurance Claim Processor

## Overview

This is a sophisticated AI-powered backend system for processing medical insurance claim documents. The system uses FastAPI as the web framework, Google's Gemini AI for document classification and text extraction, and implements a multi-agent architecture to handle different types of medical documents (bills, discharge summaries, ID cards, etc.).

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a multi-agent architecture pattern with the following key components:

### Backend Framework
- **FastAPI**: Asynchronous web framework for high-performance API endpoints
- **Python 3.8+**: Core runtime with async/await support
- **CORS enabled**: Allows cross-origin requests for frontend integration

### AI Integration
- **Google Gemini API**: Primary LLM for document classification, text extraction, and data structuring
- **Model**: Uses `gemini-2.5-flash` as the default model
- **Temperature**: Set to 0.1 for consistent, deterministic responses

### Multi-Agent System
- **BaseAgent**: Abstract base class for all document processing agents
- **BillAgent**: Specialized for medical bills and invoices
- **DischargeAgent**: Handles discharge summaries and medical reports
- **IdCardAgent**: Processes ID cards and insurance cards
- **DocumentClassifier**: AI-powered document type classification

## Key Components

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
- **Text Extraction**: PyPDF2 for primary text extraction with Gemini enhancement for low-quality extractions
- **Document Classification**: AI-powered classification based on content and filename
- **Agent Orchestration**: Routes documents to appropriate specialized agents
- **Data Validation**: Cross-validates extracted data for consistency

### 2. API Layer
- **Single Endpoint**: `/process-claim` accepts multiple PDF files
- **Response Model**: Structured JSON responses with extracted data and claim decisions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for malformed responses and processing failures

### 3. Data Models
- **Pydantic Schemas**: Type-safe data models for all document types
- **Enums**: Document types and claim statuses for consistency
- **Validation**: Built-in data validation with Pydantic

### 4. Utility Services
- **JSON Parser**: Safe parsing of LLM responses with error recovery
- **PDF Utils**: Low-level PDF processing utilities
- **Validator**: Data consistency and completeness validation

## Data Flow

1. **Document Upload**: Multiple PDF files uploaded via `/process-claim` endpoint
2. **Text Extraction**: PyPDF2 extracts raw text, enhanced by Gemini if needed
3. **Classification**: Gemini classifies each document type based on content
4. **Agent Processing**: Specialized agents extract structured data from each document
5. **Validation**: Cross-validation ensures data consistency across documents
6. **Decision Making**: Final approve/reject decision based on validation results
7. **Response**: Structured JSON response with all extracted data and decision

## External Dependencies

### Primary Dependencies
- **Google Gemini API**: Core AI functionality for all LLM operations
- **PyPDF2**: PDF text extraction library
- **FastAPI**: Web framework with async support
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for FastAPI

### Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: All configuration through env vars
- **API Keys**: Gemini API key required for operation
- **Configurable Limits**: File size, request limits, and AI parameters

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Local development with environment variables
- **Production**: Containerizable with Docker (implied by structure)
- **Configuration**: Centralized config management in `config.py`

### Scalability Considerations
- **Async Processing**: Full async/await implementation for concurrent processing
- **Stateless Design**: No persistent state, suitable for horizontal scaling
- **Resource Management**: Configurable limits for file processing

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive logging throughout the pipeline
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error handling and reporting
- **Performance Metrics**: Processing time tracking for optimization

### Example Success Response
```json
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "type": "bill",
      "hospital_name": "ABC General Hospital", 
      "total_amount": 675.0,
      "date_of_service": "2024-01-15"
    },
    {
      "type": "discharge_summary",
      "patient_name": "John Smith",
      "diagnosis": "Acute Appendicitis",
      "admission_date": "2024-01-15",
      "discharge_date": "2024-01-17"
    }
  ],
  "validation": {

  }
}
```

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Multi-Agent Architecture
**Problem**: Different document types require specialized extraction logic
**Solution**: Separate agents for each document type with shared base functionality
**Benefits**: Modular, testable, and easily extensible for new document types

### 2. Gemini API Integration
**Problem**: Need reliable AI for document classification and text extraction
**Solution**: Google Gemini API with structured response schemas
**Benefits**: High-quality AI responses with JSON schema validation

### 3. Async Processing
**Problem**: Multiple document processing can be time-consuming

**Benefits**: Better performance and resource utilization

### 4. Pydantic Data Models
**Problem**: Need type-safe data structures for complex medical data
**Solution**: Pydantic models with validation and serialization
**Benefits**: Type safety, automatic validation, and clear API contracts

### 5. Centralized Configuration
**Problem**: Multiple configuration parameters across different services
**Solution**: Single configuration class with environment variable support
**Benefits**: Easy deployment configuration and environment management

### 6. Robust Error Handling
